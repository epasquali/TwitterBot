"# TwitterBot" 

Series of files with gem to create a simple Twitter bot with fairly versatile functions including add friends, cull friend list, data mine, retweet, generate a random tweet, etc.

The basic gem is found on the TwitterBotGem directory.

The basic scripts including README file on how to use is in the TwitterBotScripts directory.

An example of how to use the TwitterBotScripts for the specific case of FixMyCV twitter account is on the FixMyCVBot directory.


Note this was the very first Ruby project I ever did and it hasn't been maintained since that initial foray into Ruby. It could be re-written much better now! Particularly, a lot of the stuff on the TwitterBotScripts directory should actually better go into the TwitterBotGem, and then the actual FixMyCVbot would just add the pictures and tweets .txt files and none of the actual ruby scripts. But hey, live and learn, right? I've become a far better ruby coder since then! Only I haven't had a chance to update the code because I ended up being sidetracked into other projects.
